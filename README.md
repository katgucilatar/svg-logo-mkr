## Description
This SVG Logo Maker app was created for an assignment by UNC Coding Bootcamp. This app utilizes Inquirer so that the user can custom create their own SVG logo and utilizes Jest to run passing tests for the JavaScript files in the lib folder.

## Installation
In order to download this code from the repository, one must have a software such as VS Code or one that's similar. Along with VS Code, it is necessary to download Node.JS as many components of this code such as Inquirer can only be access through Node.JS.  
It is recommended to view this following walkthrough video to see how Node.JS is used in this app: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/dn9HVHS5LF9tBtpc4a1K

## Tests
Upon installing everything, this app works in the terminal. Type "node index.js" for the Inquirer questions to pop up. The terminal will then ask the user the text of their logo, desired color for the logo text, desired shape of the logo, and desired color for the shape of the logo. Upon answering all these questions, an SVG logo will then be generated for the user.
